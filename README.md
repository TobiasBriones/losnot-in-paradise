Losnot in paradise is a 2D video game made in Java where the main character --Los-- is located in a
strange world full of obstacles, and his mission is to get out of that place alive.

I initially wrote this game back in 2018 with the intention to develop an AI algorithm, so that the
game gets able to play on its own, and I can show the world the power of AI. I got the name of the
game influenced by Rihanna "Lost in paradise" song (which in fact it got played randomly at the
moment of pushing the initial commit to this project, and I know it's not a pure coincidence) and
also the fact that the obstacles in the game make it quite tough to overcome, so that you are
obviously lost but not precisely in paradise.
